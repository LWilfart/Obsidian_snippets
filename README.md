Bunch of obsidian snippets I made to customize my vault (exept : Cards.css)

* **Cards.css** is from https://github.com/sponsors/kepano for minimal theme but can be implement in any theme by using Cards.css<br />

    It transform dataview tables into cards
* **body.css**

  It modifies the reading length in reading and edit mode so they match
    
* **centerh1.css**

  It centers the H1 heading if you use cssclass centerh1 in metadata
